## WebApp - TV shows

### Description

You are the owner of a OTT platform in **Atlantic City,** on the Theatrical homeworld of Atlanta. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. You are the main exporter of Computer Technology for the New Republic so naturally you roll up your sleeves and get to work. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

-   Implement a detail view for the shows in the list
-   Make sure that bookmarking / linking to detail pages works as expected
